# Computer Labs

## Assessment Criteria

Solved exercises from labs should be sent 
within two weeks. You will get a point for the 
completion of each notebook. The grades will be 
assigned according to the standard scale (complete at
least 50% to pass). These grades will not impact
the lecture grades.
