    "# Key Molecular Properties in Drug Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug design is a process that needs to take into accounts multiple parameters. First, the molecule needs to be of course active, i.e. interact with its biological target to induce some therapeutic effect. Second, this molecule should also have a set of other desirable molecular properties that are known under the term ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity). These properties ensure that our compound will reach its target and will not induce any side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological activity of a compound is measured in a laboratory by conducting biological **assays** that tests how well our molecule binds and interacts with its biological target. An assay can be done using proteins or whole cells, and there are many types of activity measurements that can be done. For example, we can test only if the molecule binds to its target or look for a specific interaction that causes a desirable effect or inhibition. The activity values are usually expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EC$_{50}$**/**IC$_{50}$** - molecule concentration at which half of the effect or inhibition (blockage) is reached; the lower this value is, the stronger the effect induced by the molecule is.\n",
    "- **Ki** - the inhibition constant, which measures the binding affinity; again, lower values correspond to stronger binding.\n",
    "- **Inhibition in %** - the percentage of inhibited proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, XC$_{50}$ and Ki values are converted to the negative logarithmic scale. This is denoted by the letter \"*p*\" in front of the activity type. This operation reduces the impact of extremely high values. After this transformation, higher values correspond to stronger activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, pIC$_{50}$ = $-\\log_{10} $ IC$_{50}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ADMET\n",
    "\n",
    "There are myriads of chemical properties that can be measured to ensure the success of our molecule. Depending on the drug target, we might want to optimize different ADMET properties. If our drug needs to work in the central nervous system, we need to check the **blood-brain barrier permeability**. Other drugs that are administered orally need to **absorbed in the intestine**. Our molecule needs to be **metabolically stable**, which means it is not metabolized before it reaches its destination. On the other hand, we need to make sure it is finally metabolized and does not accumulate in the organism. Eventually, drugs can not be **toxic** or induce any serious side effects by interacting with other biological targets (**off-targets**). This is a difficult property to optimize as toxicity is a non-specific property - there are many possible interactions that can cause toxicity, e.g. **hERG inhibition** leads to severe cardiotoxicity (blocked potassium ion channels will cause heart failure)."

    "# ChEMBL\n",
    "\n",
    "[ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) is a public database of bioactive compounds. The experimentally measured data points are gathered here and they can be used to train machine learning models. It should be noted that this database is manually curated, and the data is pulled from publications and patents. The quality of this data is not always perfect, and the same compound can have multiple drastically different activity values depending on the site the experiments were conducted in. Sometimes these values can contain errors, either caused by humans or incorrect parsing of source documents.\n",

The model performance measured this way can be misleading as ChEMBL contains many similar compounds, series of compounds containing the same scaffold, or even duplicated records. Thus, a better form of evaluation would be to employ a more advanced splitting method, e.g. **scaffold-based split** in which all compounds containing the same scaffold are put in the same set. Another option is to use a **time-based split** because most records in ChEBML should be tagged with the date of their publication. \n",
